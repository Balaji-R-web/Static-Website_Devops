## Static Website Hosting using Jenkins, Terraform, and AWS

This project explains how I hosted a static website using AWS S3 with deployment automated using Jenkins and infrastructure provisioned using Terraform.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Set Up AWS IAM

* Created an IAM user with:

  * Programmatic access
  * Permissions: `AmazonS3FullAccess`
* Collected the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Create Website Files

* Created a folder named `website`
* Added `index.html` file with basic HTML content

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Write Terraform Code

* Created `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf` in a `terraform` folder

**main.tf** provisions:

* AWS provider setup
* S3 bucket for static site
* Bucket policy to allow public read access

**variables.tf** contains:

* Access key, secret key, and bucket name

**outputs.tf** prints:

* The static site URL

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Install Jenkins on EC2

* Launched Amazon Linux EC2 instance
* Installed Java and Jenkins
* Configured the Jenkins service

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Configure Jenkins

* Installed required Jenkins plugins:

  * Git
  * Pipeline
  * AWS CLI
  * Terraform
* Added AWS credentials to Jenkins
* Created a **Freestyle** or **Pipeline job**

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Jenkins Pipeline (CI/CD)

* Wrote a `Jenkinsfile` with stages:

  1. Clone code from GitHub
  2. Initialize Terraform
  3. Apply Terraform to create S3 bucket
  4. Upload `index.html` to S3 using AWS CLI

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Trigger Build

* Ran the Jenkins job
* Terraform created the S3 bucket
* Website files were uploaded

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 8: Access the Website

* Opened the URL shown in Terraform output:

  ```
  http://<bucket-name>.s3-website-<region>.amazonaws.com
  ```
